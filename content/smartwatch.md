<p style="text-align:justify;"> Every half hour or so my watch insists that I stand up &mdash; as if I were the laziest person ever. It's a subtle yet persistent <i>urging</i> that conveys a sense of failure if I don't comply. The problem I see, however, isn't the command itself: it's the implicit accusation behind it: <b>you're not doing enough</b>. Are we supposed to adjust our routines to these aspiring digital overlords or should those devices start suiting us better?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Maybe I am the only one to blame for being guilt-tripped into activity by my wrist (sort of). Am I <i>really</i> supposed to rearrange my day around this little piece of tech? Watches, phones (or even those fancy Samsung fridges) are sold as tools for better living. They promise a smarter, more organized propulsion to our lives but is this really offering a way towards a better version of ourselves or just turning us into obedient minions of a sentient algorithm?</p>

<blockquote>Hasn't anyone considered that maybe people <i>like</i> sitting for a while?</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The core question here is whether <b>we should adapt to these machines or if they should adapt to us</b>. The middle ground is not as clear as one might think. If there is yielding to every notification, there is slavery to the device &mdash; days shaped not by need but by algorithms optimized for unknown metrics. If there is a complete resistance, we run the risk of missing out on the <i>potential</i> benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The middle ground, I suppose, is selective adaptation. Devices should only complement one's routine and not dictate it. A smartwatch can suggest, as it does, but shouldn't demand. There's room for negotiation between human intuition and cold, heartless logic. For instance, I can appreciate a gentle reminder to stretch after sitting for hours &mdash; but I don't need my watch to scold me for not hitting a step goal when I'm deep in the middle of writing or enjoying the city view on my balcony.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">What is truly absurd is how quick it is to internalize those prompts. Until I could set different activity goals on watchOS 11, I felt guilty for not "closing the rings" on a given day, as if the act of having a rest day somehow diminishes my worth. But perhaps this is just a broader cultural obsession with constant improvement, optimization and <i>productivity</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, maybe I'll stand up the next time my watch tells me to. In the end, the trick is just balancing the tech with the human autonomy &mdash; an adaptable symbiosis rather than controlled routine.</p>
