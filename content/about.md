title: I, myself
---

Iâ€™m Vitor Zanetti, an urbanophilic, craft beer enthusiast, double espresso appreciator, and a fan of all things David Lynch.

I speak English, Portuguese, Italian, and some French. My main interests are architecture, design, computers, beer, collecting, LEGOs, and cats.

If you enjoy what I write, thank you.
