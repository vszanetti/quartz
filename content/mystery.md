<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>What if the most fulfilling answers are the ones we never find out?</i> is a question worthy of keeping us up at night. In an age where search engines stand out to resolve any uncertainty within seconds and TV shows feel compelled to explain every plot point, and people are obsessed with tying up every loose and dissect, explain, and "uncover" even the slightest unsureness, mystery itself seems endangered. But what if the best mysteries are the ones left untouched?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Cinema sphere, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/">David Lynch</a> is a defiant guardian of mystery. His movies feel like fever dreams that stubbornly resist explanation and actively provoke discomfort with the unexplained. Take <i>Twin Peaks</i> for example, perhaps the greatest TV drama series ever created. When fans demanded answers about the cryptic finale, Lynch just left them all in the fog. To truly <i>get it</i>, one must embrace the confusion and, in particular, find an odd satisfaction in <i>not getting it</i>. I side with those who believe that the question itself matters more than the answer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I had a friend who couldn't resist googling the end of every thriller movie before he even finished the first half hour. Every twist and every turn had to be spoiled before there was even a chance for surprise. "Why do you do this to yourself?" I once asked. "I hate not knowing", he answered to me. But this resistance to explanation isn't just artistic stubbornness &mdash; it's a profound perception of how human minds engage with mystery. It could just be that the act of knowing steals something from you because it robs the experience of its essence, the unknown. In other words, the thrill of discovery feels like opening a Christmas gift early: sure, you know what's inside, but the joy of finding out is now gone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Maybe we've grown allergic to mystery, and this allergy has spread into every corner of life. The need for constant answers is like a soul-crushing, architectural blueprint that's been photocopied too many times &mdash; sure, it's clear, but it has lost all depth, all intrigue, all personality. The same goes for the human experience: when every single mystery is now known, what's left to explore?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider the greatest scientific discoveries throughout history &mdash; they often began not with answers, but with someone willing to dwell in uncertainty long enough to see something new. For instance, the double-helix structure DNA came up to Francis Crick in a dream and not logical deduction; Georg Cantor affirmed that he received the theory of sets directly from God and Kekul√© said that he dreamed about Ouroboros prior to discovering the structure of Benzene. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern obsession with explanation extends into personal lives too, as for example dating apps promise to reduce romance to algorithms and personality tests claim to capture human complexity in four-letter codes. Social media demands we make every thought and feeling explicitly clear, but in this rush to explain everything the rich territory of the implicit and <i>mysteriously suggested</i> is being misunderstood, if not totally lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a Japanese concept called <i>yugen</i> &mdash; the subtle profundity of things that cannot be directly expressed. It's found in the space between words, in the shadow that suggests more than light reveals, in the question that opens rather than closes possibilities. Western culture, with its demand for clear answers and explicit meanings could learn from this appreciation of the unexpressed. From this, one can effortlessly cultivate this idea that perhaps the best mysteries are the ones that keep us guessing, that leave room for interpretation, that defy explanation. After all, where's the fun if everything is figured out? More importantly, where's the growth, wonder and impact that makes us human?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The joy of unsolved mystery isn't about willful ignorance or refusing to seek understanding. Rather, it can be argued that it's about recognizing some truths as too complex, too nuanced, too alive to be pinned down like butterflies in a collection. Sometimes the most honest answer is simply<i>I don't know</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the end, mystery isn't a problem to be solved but a space to be inhabited &mdash; a fertile void where imagination grows, where possibility lives, and where the human spirit finds room to dance with the unknown. In a world increasingly stripped of wonder, perhaps protecting these spaces of uncertainty is not just a pleasure, but a necessity.</p>
