<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm against the exhausting and invasive constant data grabs on websites. Yet, I run analytics on this website. <s>Not the cookie-based kind, though â€” I use <a href="https://umami.is"><b>Umami</b></a>, a non-invasive and GDPR compliant analytics tool. There is no personal data being stored and certainly no data being sold.</s> <br> Due to an issue with <b>Umami</b>, I've temporarily moved to Google Analytics.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It's just the bare minimum that helps me understand, through statistics, what is and what isn't working around here.</p>
