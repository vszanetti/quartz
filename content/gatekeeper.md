While the intention behind Apple's recent move to tighten Gatekeeper's security feels like another step towards a trend of Macs risking becoming oversized iPads with keyboards by making macOS more like iOS, its implementation could use some refinement.

Mac users aren't just casual tech guys, many are developers, designers, and power users who appreciate macOS for its UNIX heritage and flexibility (as noticed by Apple, whose computers are marketed as professional-grade machines). Navigating through this system shouldn't need constant guidance - for those who frequently use tools like **MacPorts**, **Homebrew**, or custom software, this approach is starting to feel more frustrating than helpful.

While it is argued that this is just a minor inconvenience that helps block scammers, the underlying issue is about ownership and control. I, among others, believe people should have the freedom to manage their own devices without needing Apple's approval at every turn.

Some suggest that those frustrated with these changes might consider switching to Linux. But should one really have to consider leaving macOS behind because of increasingly restrictive policies?
