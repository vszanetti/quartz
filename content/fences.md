# Topics most discussed

## Design
- **[Sonic signatures](asonicsignature)**: During a breakfast with a friend, I realized the significance of sound design in our digital interactions as the keyboard clicks from his iPhone reminded me how these auditory cues, often muted in my own life, add intentionality and richness to the user experience.
- **[Can a kid draw it?](canakiddrawit)**: Simplicity in tech design, exemplified by Apple’s products, enhances usability and appeal, but true design excellence lies in balancing accessibility with functionality and innovation, rather than merely adhering to a child-like simplicity as discussed in the text.
- **[The "gamer" aesthetic is beyond awful](gamer)**: The gaming industry’s design aesthetic, dominated by flashy and superficial elements reminiscent of neon kitsch, suggests a missed opportunity for sophistication in gaming hardware.

## Internet

- **[Dreams of convenience](dreamsofconvenience)**: As digital platforms prioritize profit over user experience, the internet feels more suffocating than ever, with personal interactions overshadowed by excessive advertisements and misleading content.
- **[What about me?](whataboutme)**: The <i>What about me?</i> effect highlights a cognitive bias where online content must cater to specific needs.
